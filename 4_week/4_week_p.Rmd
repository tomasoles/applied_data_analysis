**Characteristics of tidy data:**

- Each variable forms a column.
- Each observation forms a row.
- Each type of observational unit forms a table.

# Data structures in R

## Data structures in R
Three main ways to store data:

- Matrix: 
  - Requires all the elements to be of the same type (e.g. numeric or character)
- Data frame: 
  - Allows for mixed types of variables
- Tibble: 
  - Like a data frame, but works more consistently

---

## Tibbles don't change names

. . .
.midi[
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
(df = data.frame("a" = 1:5, "b 2" = 5:1))
(ti = tibble("a" = 1:5, "b 2" = 5:1))
```
]
---

## Tibbles complain about bad column names

. . .

```{r}
df$c
ti$c
```

---

## Tibbles subset consistently

. . .

```{r}
df[,1]
ti[,1]
```

---

## Tibbles don't *do* partial matching

. . .

```{r}
df$b
ti$b
```
---

## Tibbles don't coerce strings to factors

Previously...
```{r}
df = data.frame(l1 = letters[1:5])
```
```{r,include=FALSE}
df = data.frame(l1 = letters[1:5],stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```
The most annoying thing about data frames:
```{r}
df$l2 = letters[1:5]
class(df$l1)
class(df$l2)
```

---

# Tibbles don't have this problem
```{r}
## but with tibbles it's all the same
ti = tibble(l1 = letters[1:5])
ti$l2 = letters[1:5]
class(ti$l1)
class(ti$l2)
```

## Wrangling
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l4q7WOA7pYUnNuiD6/giphy.gif)
---

## A grammar of data wrangling...

... based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames


.midi[
- `select`: pick columns by name
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `distinct`: filter for unique rows
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `summarize`: reduce variables to values
- `group_by`: for grouped operations
- ... (many more)
]


---

## Rules of **dplyr** functions

- First argument is *always* a data frame
- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame
- Always return a data frame
- Don't modify in place

---

## Data: Hotel bookings

- Data from two hotels: one resort and one city hotel
- Observations: Each row represents a hotel booking
- Goal for original data collection: Development of prediction models to classify a hotel booking's likelihood to be canceled ([Antonia et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191#bib5))

```{r message=FALSE}
hotels <- read_csv("data/hotels.csv")
```
---


## First look: Variables

```{r output.lines=15}
names(hotels)
```

---

## Second look: Overview
.medi[
```{r output.lines=5}
glimpse(hotels)
```
]
---

## Select a single column

View only `lead_time` (number of days between booking and arrival date):

```{r}
select(hotels, lead_time)
```

---

## Select a single column

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE}
select( #<<
  hotels, 
  lead_time
  )
```
]
.pull-right[
- Start with the function (a verb): `select()`
]

---

## Select a single column

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE}
select( 
  hotels, #<<
  lead_time
  )
```
]
.pull-right[
- Start with the function (a verb): `select()`
- First argument: data frame we're working with , `hotels`
]

---

## Select a single column

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE}
select( 
  hotels, 
  lead_time #<<
  )
```
]
.pull-right[
- Start with the function (a verb): `select()`
- First argument: data frame we're working with , `hotels`
- Second argument: variable we want to select, `lead_time`
]

---

## Select a single column

.pull-left[
```{r}
select( 
  hotels, 
  lead_time
  )
```
]
.pull-right[
- Start with the function (a verb): `select()`
- First argument: data frame we're working with , `hotels`
- Second argument: variable we want to select, `lead_time`
- Result: data frame with `r nrow(hotels)` rows and 1 column
]

---

.tip[
dplyr functions always expect a data frame and always yield a data frame.
]

```{r}
select(hotels, lead_time)
```

---

## Select multiple columns


View only the `hotel` type and `lead_time`:

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
select(hotels, hotel, lead_time)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
.question[
What if we wanted to select these columns, and then arrange the data in descending order of lead time?
]
]

---

## Data wrangling, step-by-step

.pull-left[
Select:
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time)
```
]

--
.pull-right[
Select, then arrange:
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>%
  arrange(desc(lead_time))
```

# Pipes

---

## What is a pipe?

In programming, a pipe is a technique for passing information from one process to another.

--

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `hotels`, and pass it to the `select()` function,
]
.pull-right[
.small[
```{r}
hotels %>% #<<
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>%
  arrange(desc(lead_time))
```
]
]

---

]
.pull-right[
.small[

  arrange(desc(lead_time))
```
]
]

  arrange(desc(lead_time)) #<<
```
]
]

## How does a pipe work?

- You can think about the following sequence of actions - find keys, 
unlock car, start car, drive to work, park.

--
- Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:
```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "work"))
```

--
- Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) 
structure:
```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "work") %>%
  park()
```

---
## What about other arguments?

Use the dot to

- send results to a function argument other than first one or 
- use the previous result for multiple arguments

```{r fig.height=1.8, fig.width = 3.75}
hotels %>%
  filter(hotel == "Resort Hotel") %>%
  lm(adr ~ lead_time, data = .) #<<
```

---
## A note on piping and layering

- `%>%` used mainly in **dplyr** pipelines, *we pipe the output of the previous line of code as the first input of the next line of code*

--
- `+` used in **ggplot2** plots is used for "layering", *we create the plot in layers, separated by `+`*

---

## `select` to keep variables
```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
hotels <- read_csv("data/hotels.csv")
```
.medi[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) #<<
```
]
---

## `select` to exclude variables

.small[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(-agent) #<<
```
]

---

## `select` a range of variables
.medi[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel:arrival_date_month) #<<
```
]
---

## `select` variables with certain characteristics
.medi[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(starts_with("arrival")) #<<
```
]
---

## `select` variables with certain characteristics
.medi[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(ends_with("type")) #<<
```
]
---

## Select helpers

- `starts_with()`: Starts with a prefix
- `ends_with()`: Ends with a suffix
- `contains()`: Contains a literal string
- `num_range()`: Matches a numerical range like x01, x02, x03
- `one_of()`: Matches variable names in a character vector
- `everything()`: Matches all variables
- `last_col()`: Select last variable, possibly with an offset
- `matches()`: Matches a regular expression (a sequence of symbols/characters expressing a string/pattern to be searched for within text)

.footnote[
See help for any of these functions for more info, e.g. `?everything`.
]

---

## `arrange` in ascending / descending order

.pull-left[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(adults, children, babies) %>%
  arrange(babies) #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(adults, children, babies) %>%
  arrange(desc(babies)) #<<
```
]

---

## `slice` for certain row numbers

.midi[
```{r}
# first five
hotels %>%
  slice(1:5) #<<
```
]

---



## `slice` for certain row numbers

.small[
```{r}
# last five
last_row <- nrow(hotels)         # nrow() gives the number of rows in a data frame
hotels %>%
  slice((last_row - 4):last_row) #<<
```
]

---

## `filter` to select a subset of rows

.small[
```{r}
# bookings in City Hotels
hotels %>%
  filter(hotel == "City Hotel") #<<
```
]

---

## `filter` for many conditions at once
.medi[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  filter( 
    adults == 0,     #<<
    children >= 1    #<<
    ) %>% 
  select(adults, babies, children)
```
]
---

## `filter` for more complex conditions
.midi[
```{r}
# bookings with no adults and some children or babies in the room
hotels %>%
  filter( 
    adults == 0,     
    children >= 1 | babies >= 1     # | means or  #<<
    ) %>%
  select(adults, babies, children)
```
]
---



```{r include=FALSE}
options(dplyr.print_max = 20)
```






## `distinct` to filter for unique rows

... and `arrange` to order alphabetically

.small[
.pull-left[
```{r}
hotels %>% 
  distinct(market_segment) %>% #<<
  arrange(market_segment)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
hotels %>% 
  distinct(hotel, market_segment) %>% #<<
  arrange(hotel, market_segment)
```
]
]

---

## `count` to create frequency tables

.pull-left[
```{r}
# alphabetical order by default
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment) #<<
```
]
--
.pull-right[
```{r}
# descending frequency order
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment, sort = TRUE) #<<
```
]

---

## `count` and `arrange`

.pull-left[
```{r}
# ascending frequency order
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment) %>%
  arrange(n) #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
# descending frequency order
# just like adding sort = TRUE
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) #<<
```
]

---

## `count` for multiple variables
.medi[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  count(hotel, market_segment) #<<
```
]
---

## order matters when you `count`

.midi[
.pull-left[
```{r}
# hotel type first
hotels %>%
  count(hotel, market_segment) #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
# market segment first
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment, hotel) #<<
```
]
]

---


## `mutate` to add a new variable
.medi[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  mutate(little_ones = children + babies) %>% #<<
  select(children, babies, little_ones) %>%
  arrange(desc(little_ones))
```
]
---



## Little ones in resort and city hotels

.midi[
.pull-left[
```{r}
# Resort Hotel
hotels %>%
  mutate(little_ones = children + babies) %>%
  filter(
    little_ones >= 1,
    hotel == "Resort Hotel"
    ) %>%
  select(hotel, little_ones)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
# City Hotel
hotels %>%
  mutate(little_ones = children + babies) %>%
  filter(
    little_ones > 1,
    hotel == "City Hotel"
    )  %>%
  select(hotel, little_ones)
```
]
]

---

.question[
What is happening in the following chunk?
]

.midi[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  mutate(little_ones = children + babies) %>%
  count(hotel, little_ones) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
```
]

---

# `summarize` for summary stats

```{r}
# mean average daily rate for all bookings
hotels %>%
  summarize(mean_adr = mean(adr)) #<<
```

--

<br>

.tip[
`summarize()` changes the data frame entirely, it collapses rows down to a single 
summary statistic, and removes all columns that are irrelevant to the calculation.
]

---

.tip[
`summarize()` also lets you get away with being lazy and not naming your new 
column, but that's not recommended!
]

.midi[


```{r}
hotels %>%
  summarize(mean(adr))
```



```{r}
hotels %>%
  summarize(mean_adr = mean(adr))
```
]

---

# `group_by` for grouped operations

```{r}
# mean average daily rate for all booking at city and resort hotels
hotels %>%
  group_by(hotel) %>% #<<
  summarize(mean_adr = mean(adr))
```

---

## Calculating frequencies

The following two give the same result, so `count` is simply short for `group_by` then determine frequencies 

.pull-left[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  group_by(hotel) %>%
  summarize(n = n())
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  count(hotel)
```
]

---

# Multiple summary statistics

`summarize` can be used for multiple summary statistics as well

```{r}
hotels %>%
  summarize(
    min_adr = min(adr),
    mean_adr = mean(adr),
    median_adr = median(adr),
    max_adr = max(adr)
    )
```
